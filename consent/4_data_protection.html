      <h4>Legal basis</h4>
      <p>
        The legal basis for processing your personal data is your voluntary written consent in accordance with Art. 6
        Paragraph 1 lit. a GDPR, or Art. 9 Paragraph 2 lit. a GDPR, as far as special categories of personal data are
        concerned. The data
        protection regulations are observed at all times.
        In addition, we work on the basis of the Declaration of Helsinki (declaration of the World Medical Association
        on the ethical principles for medical research on humans) as well as the guideline for good clinical practice
        and follow the
        recommendations of the German Research Foundation (DFG) to ensure good scientific practice.
      </p>
      <h4>Types of data and purposes of use</h4>
      <p>
        As part of the study “Visual and Auditory Memory“, the keyboard responses you submit during the
        experiment are comprised.
        The subject matter of the study is exclusively the experimental data, which will be statistically
        aggregated and used as a basis for scientific publication.
      </p>
      <h4>Storage and Access</h4>
      <!-- <p>
        Via your Prolific ID we have access to the data that you have provided to Prolific, such as your age
        and gender.
        However, the subject matter of the study is exclusively the experimental data, which will be statistically
        aggregated and used as a basis for scientific publication.
      </p> -->
      <p>
        The experimental data is going to be pseudonymized, i.e. we store it together with a code which is the only
        thing that connects your data to your personal information. In this way, you can keep the option of withdrawing
        your consent for the
        storage and analysis of your data after the experiment. This code is stored in our database and is only
        accessible to the members of our lab.
        It will be deleted after 10 years, thus fully anonymizing the data.
      <p>
        You have the right to access all the information about your data and demand
        amendments, if necessary. Please refer to the principal investigator or experimenter.
      </p>
      <h4>Publication</h4>
      <p>
        The publication of the research results in publications or at conferences takes place exclusively in an
        anonymous form so that you cannot be identified as a person.
      </p>
      <h4>Storage period, possible re-use</h4>
      <p>
        The evaluation of experimental data from this study is primarily carried out by the project manager and his
        staff.
        Please note, however, that according to the rules of good scientific practice, experimental data must be kept
        for at least ten years and must be made available to other scientists in anonymized form on request.
        In accordance with the recommendations of the German Research Foundation (DFG) and the German Society for
        Psychology (DGPs) for quality assurance in research, research data should, if possible, be made available to
        other scientists
        for research purposes.
        Completely anonymized data can be used within the framework of the recommendations of the German Research
        Foundation (DFG) and the German Society for Psychology (DGPs) for quality assurance in research on the basis
        of Art. 6 Para. 1
        lit. f GDPR are made freely available to the general public. This can include uploading the whole anonymized
        data set to
        a public research database.
      </p>
      <h4>You have the following rights regarding your personal data:</h4>
      <p>
        <i>Consent to the processing of personal data and the right to withdraw consent</i><br>
        The processing of your personal data is only lawful with your consent. You are not obliged to consent to the
        processing; consent is voluntary.
        You also have the right to revoke your consent to the processing of personal data at any time to the person
        responsible for the future (as long as the data is not anonymous). You will not suffer any legal disadvantages
        if you refuse or withdraw
        your consent.
        If you withdraw your consent, the processing of the personal data concerned will be inadmissible in the
        future in accordance with the declaration of withdrawal. This does not affect the legality of the processing
        carried out until the revocation.
        <br><i>Right to information</i><br>
        You have the right to be informed about the personal data relating to you that is collected, processed or, if
        necessary, transmitted to third parties in our working group (Art. 15 GDPR).
        <br><i>Right to rectification</i><br>
        You have the right to have incorrect personal data concerning you corrected (Art. 16 GDPR).
        <br><i>Right to cancellation</i><br>
        Under the legal requirements, you have the right to have your personal data deleted (Art. 17 GDPR), e.g. if
        this data is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected and there are no legal retention
        periods to prevent deletion or you have withdrawn your consent and there is no other legal basis for
        processing. In principle, anonymized data can no longer be deleted, as no connection can be established
        between data and person.
        <br><i>Right to restriction of processing</i><br>
        You have the right to request the person responsible to restrict the processing if one of the requirements of
        Art.
        18 Para. 1 GDPR applies.
        <br><i>Right to data portability</i><br>
        Under the conditions of Art. 20 (1) GDPR, you have the right to data portability.
        <br><i>Right to object</i><br>
        If there are reasons in your particular situation, you have the right to object to the processing of your
        personal data. In principle, processing will then no longer take place unless the processing is still required
        by law.
        <br><i>Right of appeal</i><br>
        You have the right to lodge a complaint with a national supervisory authority if you have any doubts about the
        legality of the processing of your personal data. The responsible supervisory authority for the Charité -
        Universitätsmedizin Berlin is the Berlin Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information.
        Without prejudice to this right to lodge a complaint, you can contact the Data Protection Officer of the
        Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, Tel: +49 (30) 2093-20022, E-Mail: daten-schutz@uv.hu-berlin.de, at any time if
        you have any questions about data protection.
        If you make use of your above-mentioned rights, the public body will check whether the legal requirements for
        this have been met.
        In principle, the rights mentioned cannot be applied to anonymized data, as these can no longer be associated
        with your person.
